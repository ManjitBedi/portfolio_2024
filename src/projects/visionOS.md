### Project Description

July 2024

I am currently working with getting the "White Hills" app to work natively in [visionOS](https://developer.apple.com/visionos/).  There was some challenges along the way - which is not unexpected.  I documented some of the technical details here:

I am now about to work on adding more 3D content into the app; I am exploring the use of [Reality Composer Pro](https://developer.apple.com/augmented-reality/tools/) to create 3D scenes.
