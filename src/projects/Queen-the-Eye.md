[Queen the Eye on Moby Games](https://www.mobygames.com/game/2220/queen-the-eye/)

Quote: "Queen: The eYe is a 3D action game with hand-to-hand combat and some puzzle-solving. The game has a somewhat unusual storyline and music by the rock group Queen. In the future, the world is ruled by an all-seeing machine called 'The Eye' who has gotten rid of anything which will promote freedom-of-expression or creativity. You play Dubroc, who annoyed The Eye by re-discovering music, and are sentenced to death in 'The Arena', a show broadcast to the world in which the contestant battles fighting ."

I worked as a script programmer on some of the game levels.  A custom scripting language with an IDE was created for this game.

I remember getting to have a conversation with Brian May, the guitarist from Queen, about game design when he came to visit the office in Windsor; I was living in the UK at the time.
