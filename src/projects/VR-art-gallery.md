Work in progress - 2020 to now.  We both got busy with other projects & work - this work is very much in the "trying things out" stage; we do want to get back to it.

We constructed a few experiment made with Unity:
 
- digitized models in a virtual space
- an experiments with 360ยบ video with some 3D models in VR

I met Juan some years ago while visiting Buenos Aires, Argentina. We have a mutual friend. Juan & I have been experimenting with making virtual versions of his artwork for VR & so on. The first iteration of this VR gallery was made a few years ago to try things out.

One of the challenges is working with digitized meshes of real world objects & having them scaled to the correct size.  The typical workflow in VR is to have 1 unit in Unity be equivalent to 1 meter.  If I could do it again, I would be there when the sculptures were being digitized and made into 3D assets.  The assets were made before, we talked about getting some of them into VR.

Collaborating with Juan has been very interesting & rewarding - he makes the art content & I do the technical part of getting his artwork into virtual mediums.
