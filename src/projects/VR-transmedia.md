I wanted to mention this project - it was interesting as it was to be a VR experience to be a companion to a film release. It was for a fictionalized film based on a true events.

The brief was to recreate one of the locations from the film & by interacting with objects in VR, short film clips would play.

One of the challenges was we did not have a floor plan for the room being recreated; the technical artist to the best of his ability recreated the location from the film footage. 

The lessons learned on this project were:

- storyboarding is essential when going over a brief with the client
- grey box scenes to get in front of the client to try out before production gets very far along
