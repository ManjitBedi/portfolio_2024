I met Juan some years ago while visiting Buenos Aires, Argentina. We have a mutual friend.

We have made 2 types of WebGL galleries.

- note: allow the gallery some time to load after tapping the play button

Juan & I have been experimenting with making virtual versions of his artwork for web & so on.

Collaborating with Juan has been very interesting & rewarding - he makes the art content & I do the technical part of getting his artwork into virtual mediums.

I opted to make a WebGl version of the gallery as is it easer to share work in progress that way with us being separated by 2 continents. This is one of the powers of Unity with it's cross platform support being able to deploy fairly easily to different platforms.  The gallery performance is actually not too shabby in WebGL but somethings are dodgy like the streaming video not always working.  There is also a desktop version of the project; if you want to try it out let me know.
