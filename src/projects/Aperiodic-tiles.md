### Project Description

This work I was used on a video wall in an office space.

[Aperiodic tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aperiodic_tiling)

My part of the project was to display aperiodic tiles using Touch Designer.  The work went through a few iterations to get to something usable - it was an interesting journey.  There was a team of developers working on the various parts of the project. 

[Lsystems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system)

While on this coding journey, I had explored to see if I could create the tile shapes using an L-system.

Ultimately for expediency, I would convert pre-generated SVG files to point data in Touch Designer using a Python script to create polygon objects.
