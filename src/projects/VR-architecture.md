This project was to reconstruct a real office floor in VR & then be able to try out customizing aspects of the office & allow the stakeholders to try out the layout changes in VR before committing to making the changes for real.  A good example of how VR can be used.

I was working with a product owner at a local company & I had actually visited the building site for the proposed office space & then reconstructed the floor plan in Unity working from a floor plan.

One of the challenges was we used assets for elevators from the Unity asset store; the elevators did not match the real world dimensions of the office floor; this was a time & budgetary constraint.
