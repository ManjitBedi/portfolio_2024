### Project Description

**Face Tracker, OnData** Nov. to Dec. 2018

“OnData is an interactive screen that integrates emerging technologies like computer vision, head tracking and facial analysis to create real-time data-driven artworks that respond to each individual.”

This was not an VR or AR project as such & did have some quite unique features. I worked on Unity app & as well a companion project made with Node.js. The Unity app was using the NUI Track SDK to do body movement tracking & facial analysis . The data was then sent to a [TouchDesigner](https://derivative.ca) project on a local network using open sound control (OSC). The app was using depth sensors for video & data streams being piped into the NUITrack SDK.
