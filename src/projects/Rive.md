I have been learning to how to use Rive - a tool for making animations that can be deployed to iOS, Unity, Web etc.

[Rive.app](https://www.rive.app)

I will be working on this in the short term to create some animations sequences to potentially use in the White Hills iOS app project (also in the portfolio).

I am greatly impressed by the scope of what Rive let's one to do with creating art & then animating it.
