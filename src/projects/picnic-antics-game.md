### Game Description

Picnic Antics was an puzzle matching game made in 2000 for the Open TV platform; it was made for the interactive TV game network "Two Way TV".  The ants would appear in the play area at random open positions and the goal is to move the same coloured ants besides each other to remove them & score points.

The game is played with the remote control for the set top box.

I worked as the main developer on this project; the game was coded in C.
