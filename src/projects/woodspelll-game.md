### Game Description

1996

Quote: "Woodspell is a mixture of an adventure-like puzzle-solving game and an activity centre with educational elements. The game contains various puzzles, such as matching the sound of a song or the classic "fit the right objects in the correct location" variant. Players also hear stories set in the woodland, filled with elves and fairies, or even print and colour the locations they see. The game features hand-drawn scenarios and characters, and original music by the Italian band Tazenda."
