### Project Description

2014

I worked as a developer on this project - specifically on the front end using Objective-C & some of the scripting using ladder logic.  The game engine was written by another developer - [Kearwood "Kip" Gilbert](https://kearwood.com).

Circa 1948 is an augmented reality app for the iPhone and iPad that allows users to take a virtual tour of two important sites from Vancouver’s history: Hogan’s Alley and the Old Hotel Vancouver, both since destroyed. Internationally renowned artist, Stan Douglas, has created 3D models of these locations which have been meticulously researched and are historically accurate, scripted spaces that can be physically navigated by the user. Using an iOS device as a window into the past, one will be able to literally walk into these places, on-line at the actual locations where the Alley and Hotel once stood, or off-line, anywhere in the world.
