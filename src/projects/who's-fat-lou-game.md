[Who's Fat Lou? on Mobygames](https://www.mobygames.com/game/148154/whos-fat-lou/)

Quote: "Who's Fat Lou is a point-and-click adventure game with an usual art style. In the future, you are trying to save Zett City from the evil El Guapo. You need to collect inventory items to solve traditional inventory puzzles, and also "musical inventory items" for the final musical showdown with El Guapo."

The game was conceived by the artist Amitai Plasse.  We lived in Italy at the time, working at a computer game company called Mediola; Ami & a few other international staff like myself had been hired by the company to bring more diversity to the company.  It was interesting to say the least working with a talented team of Italians & living on the island or Sardinia.  I did not know where Sardinia was before I went there for a job interview. 

I got to eat a healthy amount of Italian food & learn the language; the company had a chef on staff would make a proper 2 to 3 course lunch.  I do enjoy trying to speak Italian when I get the chance.
